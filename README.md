# TrafficSpoofer
A python program that creates fake network traffic.

This application is designed to run along side other network operations. By supporting them they create random junk traffic to an assortment of websites. This creates the illusion of normal traffic, covering up any activities that may need to be hidden. Runs entirely with a basic install of python3 with no other packages so can easily be run in containers.

Future Features
  - Websites chosen from a file
  - Multiple ports
  - Types of traffic sent in
  - Fake Authentication to make traffic more real
